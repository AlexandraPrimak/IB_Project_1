# IB_Project_1

## Global aim:

Improve casual gene prioritization by patientâ€™s phenotype
## Tasks:

1) Study the dependance between involvement of a gene in any disease and its expression specificity at a tissue  

2) Study the dependance between tissue specificity of gene expression and specificity of phenotype manifestation 

3) The same ones for dependances when using data of expression at RNA level.

## Methods used:

enrichment analysis, exact Fisher test

## OS needed:

any OS with RStudio
## Libraries used in this project (for R code):

readxl, data.table, dplyr;

ggplot2, ggthemes, cowplot, patchwork;

ontologyIndex, ontologySimilarity.

# To run the code you only need the RStudio
